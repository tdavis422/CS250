-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories were designed to help developers understand what the end users were wanting to be able to see as features inside the product being built, and can help interpret what the user needs 
to ensure everything is built the way that is intended by the customer. Interpreting user needs and implementing them can be hard if we don't know what the user wants, but that is what makes Agile
the way it is. It requires developers to be flexible and ready for change when finding out that something has been changed by the customer since the customer can't always be sure what they would like
in the beginning of the project.

-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs the way Agile specifies. I start by finding out what requirements have been said, then I build user stories out of them. I then refine them into a backlog to ensure
that I didn't miss anything. After that I start to build each feature and test each one by itself and then regression test after combining it into the main program. I hope to incoporate being able to
build working prototypes instead of debugged software to help myself speed up on being able to get through sprint a bit faster as Agile has intended to be used.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development is to be able to handle criticism from coworkers while also being able to agree with them about ideas that everyone is coming up with. Sometimes
being a good team member is hard, but not impossible. It can be difficult at any job to be a good team member, but we also have to understand that none of us are perfect and aren't on the same level
as some team members. We all have our good days and our bad days, so we shouldn't belittle some people because we never fully know what is going on in their lives.
